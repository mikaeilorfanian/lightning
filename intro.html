            <h1>README: Intro to Top 1% Developer</h1>
            <p>Is it possible to become a top 1% developer within the next 2 years so that you</p>
            <ul>
            <li>make top 1% salary compared to people with your level of experience</li>
            <li>get rated as a top 1% team member by the people you work with</li>
            <li>progress faster than 99% of the people in the industry</li>
            <li>contribute a ton of value to each project you join</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's hard to believe it, but I'm here to tell you that you can do it without even having to work harder. Actually, you'd probably end up working less. You see, most of the changes you need have to make to become a top 1% developer have to do with how you think or do things rather than what you think/do.</p>
            <p>Let me give you an example. Do you think it's possible for you to get promoted (going from Junior to regular or regular to Senior) and earn more in the next few weeks? "Well, it depends on my skills, am I even qualified to have that title?" you might say. Wrong! Your skills have little to do with your title. Apply for jobs that offer the role you want, and eventually you'll land one. Go ahead and give it a try, report back to me if it doesn't work!</p>
            <p>"How did you learn this secret?" you might ask. Good question, but I already answered it. You have to change how you think. That's what this blog is about. Of course, I will publish technical articles, but the most effective way of improving is not to learn how to write tests, or some new framework, or the XY language. Learn to think like a 1 percenter and everything else will follow.</p>
            <p>"What is this guy trying to sell? He sounds like a get-rich-quick guru or something." the skeptic in you says. First, the content on this blog is freely available. Second, I have used these ideas to great success. In just 3 years, I 10xed my salary, my teams consistently rate me as one of the best people they've worked with, and family life with my wife and son is better than ever.

            <p>Now that we got that out of the way, let me tell you about two fundamental ways exceptional people differ from sheep.</p>
